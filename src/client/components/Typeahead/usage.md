Typeahead
===========

### Description

This is a new accessible typeahead designed to replace the old typeahead. Typing into the input will filter options - this can be operated in both multi and single select modes. In multi-select mode, the selected options are shown outside of the input box as removable chips.

This is based on [accessibility research by Microsoft's Sarah Higley](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/select-your-poison-part-2/).
