    <H2>The purpose of this document</H2>
    <p>
      This website is run by the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). Export
      Wins is where DBT staff can track export wins and DBT clients can approve
      or reject their wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      DBT regularly tests its online services to ensure they meet accessibility
      requirements. Our internal development teams test frequently and we also
      undertake regular accessibility audits conducted by external agencies. We
      want our whole website to comply with <WCAGLink /> AA as a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For
      example, that means you should be able to:
    </p>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>listen to most of the website using a screen reader</ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <p>The site will:</p>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>respond to different screen sizes or zoom levels</ListItem>
      <ListItem>use words that are clear and simple to understand </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
