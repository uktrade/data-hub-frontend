# Managing Dependabot PRs

This is the process we have identified for dealing with Dependabot PRs that saves developer time and CircleCI resource.

1. Create a new branch called `chore/dependencies-[yyyy-mm-dd]`, inserting todayâ€™s date.
2. Open each Dependabot PR and check that the tests have passed. Re-run any failing tests as the majority of failures are caused by timeouts or flakiness. Codecov failures can be ignored.
3. Once all tests have passed, edit the PR so that the base branch is the `chore/dependencies` one. You should now be able to merge the PR without needing to request reviews.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all PRs are either merged or identified as needing further work. Any PRs with consistently failing tests can be passed to the Technical Excellence team if required.
5. Checkout the `chore` branch to your local machine. If required, carry out the appropriate tasks listed in the 'Additional actions' section below.
6. After all the PRs have been merged and any additional changes have been made, run `npm install`. Ensure that any changes to `package-lock.json` are included in your branch.
7. Build and run Storybook (`npm run storybook`) to ensure it works correctly (sometimes it breaks silently due to Dependabot changes).
8. Bring up your local frontend and carry out some basic smoke tests to ensure that nothing unexpected has happened.
9. Rebase the dependency branch against `master` to remove all the merge commits, then push the changes and open a PR.
10. If you are satisfied that everything is in order and all the tests have passed, request reviews as normal.
11. After merging the PR, ensure that the `release-storybook` job has passed and that Storybook is running as expected.
12. Deploy to production as soon as possible.

## Additional actions

For some dependencies, additional changes are required. These should be done as part of the main Dependabot PR.

### Babel

The `@babel/core` and `@babel/preset-env` packages should, where possible, be kept at the same version number.

### Cypress

When Cypress is updated, the version used in [`Dockerfile.dependencies`](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend/blob/master/Dockerfile.dependencies#L69) needs to be updated as well.

### Opensearch

If the Opensearch version has been updated in the API, the version used in [`docker-compose.e2e.backend`](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend/blob/master/docker-compose.e2e.backend.yml#L48) needs to be updated to match.

### React

The `react-dom` and `react` packages should, where possible, be kept at the same version number.

### Storybook / Nivo

When one of the `@storybook` dependencies is updated, the others need to be updated so they are all on the same version. This can be done with the script `storybook:update-dependencies`, which will set all Storybook dependencies to the latest version.

The same principle applies to the `@nivo` dependencies.
