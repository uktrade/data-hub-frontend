/**
 * Takes an ordinary _id unaware_ reducer and returns its _id aware_ version
 * @default
 * An _id aware_ reducer requires that its actions have an `id` property.
 * The state the reducer returns is a map of IDs to states created with the
 * decorated reducer. On each call of the reducer the state corresponding to
 * the ID of the action is updated. You wou
 * @param {(state, action: {type: string})} reducer - An _id unaware_ reducer.
 * @param {String | Array | RegExp} actionPattern - A pattern which specifies
 * which action type the reducer will subscribe to. This is needed, because
 * in Redux a reducer will receive each and every action.
 * If it's a string, it will match if the action type starts with it.
 * If it's an array, it will match if the action type is included in the array.
 * If it's a regex, it will match if the action type matches the regex
 * @returns An _id aware_ reducer.
 * @example
 * const reducer = (state = 0, {type}) =>
 *   type === 'INC' ? state + 1 : state
 *
 * const idAwareReducer = reducerDecorator(reducer, 'INC')
 *
 * const state1 = idAwareReducer(undefined, { type: 'INC', id: 'foo' })
 * // {foo: 1}
 * const state2 = idAwareReducer(state1, { type: 'INC', id: 'bar' })
 * // {foo: 1, bar: 1}
 * const state3 = idAwareReducer(state2, { type: 'INC', id: 'foo' })
 * // {foo: 2, bar: 1}

/**
 * An _id aware_ wrapper of `react-redux.connect`
 * @description
 * Works like `react-redux.connect`, with some exceptions:
 * - The resulting connected component will required the `id` prop.
 * - It's dispatch is intercepted so, that it automatically adds the `id` to all
 *   actions. The original action excluding its type is attached to the `action`
 *   property of the dispatched action.
 * - The first argument of `mapComponentToProps` will be the state specific
 *   to the ID assigned to the instance of the component. The other arguments
 *   are the original `mapComponentToProps`, i.e. the global redux state and
 *   the component props.
 * - It requires one extra argument after the wrapped component, which should
 *   be the property name to which the components _id aware_ reducer was plugged
 *   in. You can pass it alongside the wrapped component or in another pair of
 *   parentheses as the function `connect()` returns is curried.
 * @example
 * const Counter = ({count, onIncrease}) =>
 *  <button onClick={onIncrease}>{count}</button>
 *
 * const IdAwareCounter = connect(
 *   state => ({count: state}),
 *   dispatch => ({onIncrease: () => dispatch({type: 'INC'})}),
 * )(Counter, 'counterState')
 *
 * // The IdAwareCounter expects an id aware reducer to be plugged in to the
 * // root reducer at "counterState"
 * const store = createStore(combineReducers({
 *   counterState: idAwareCounterReducer,
 * }))

 * @param {React.Component} options.component - The stateless component which
 * will be forwareded to the underlying {connect} function
 * @param {(state, action) => state} options.reducer - The reducer managing the
 * component's state which will be passed to the underlying {reducerDecorator}

 * {componentStateToProps} function which will be passed to the underlying
 * {reducerDecorator}
 * @param {DispatchStateToProps} [options.dispatchToProps=] - The
 * {dispatchToProps} function which will be passed to the underlying
 * {reducerDecorator}
 * @param {Array} [options.connectArgs=[]] - Will be spread as arguments to the
 * first part of the underlying `react-redux.connect` after
 * {componentStateToProps} and {dispatchToProps}.
 * @returns An _id aware_ connected component with a `reducerSpread` property,
 * which is an object where the _id aware_ reducer is assigned to the {name}.
